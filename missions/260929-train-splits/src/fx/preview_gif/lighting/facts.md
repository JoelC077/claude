# Lighting looks: measured on the preview renders (2026-09-29)

Cameras: roof3p = coach B roof, eye 9.5 (tech.camera.eye_3p); door1p = leaning out of coach A's doorway, eye 4.5 (tech.camera.eye_1p); cab1p = loco cab facing the firebox, eye 12.0 above rail (tech.camera.cab_view); coach1p = inside coach A facing the power box. FOV 70.0; phone renders at 844x390 (tech.ui_platform.phone). Stand envelope: gauge 8, body 17.4 wide, floor 5, roof 14 (tech.units.*, OQ-030); stand-in train: navy, cream band and interiors, hazard-yellow roof rails (style.form.rails); livery open (OQ-025).

Checks against canon: spawn-edge fog >= 0.9 hides the streamer's spawn edge (tech.lighting.atmosphere, tech.streaming.window); ground saturation <= 0.45 (style.material.ground_value); bands = frame and sky means tested against the Dead Rails sepia and Land or Die blue-sky bands (style.dont.*); contrast = relative luminance ratio in the same frame.

Limits: Previews are approximations, not Roblox: Cycles + a numpy post (filmic curve, Atmosphere fog from depth, bloom, sun rays, ColorCorrection). Skybox, Future light falloff and Roblox tone mapping are not modelled; phone variants assume no shadows and no Bloom/SunRays (tech.lighting.post_low_quality). The train is a stand-in (livery open, OQ-025). Studio test pending (owner).
