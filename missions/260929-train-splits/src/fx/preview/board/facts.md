# Look-dev board: split_explosion (2026-09-29)

Presets from /home/user/claude/missions/260929-train-splits/src/fx. Tiles show the player's views (POV composites: particles over the lit plate); strips on closeups.png are construction views for shape and timing only.

## Looks

Cameras: roof3p = coach B roof, eye 9.5 (tech.camera.eye_3p); door1p = leaning out of coach A's doorway, eye 4.5 (tech.camera.eye_1p); cab1p = loco cab facing the firebox, eye 12.0 above rail (tech.camera.cab_view); coach1p = inside coach A facing the power box. FOV 70.0; phone renders at 844x390 (tech.ui_platform.phone). Stand envelope: gauge 8, body 17.4 wide, floor 5, roof 14 (tech.units.*, OQ-030); stand-in train: navy, cream band and interiors, hazard-yellow roof rails (style.form.rails); livery open (OQ-025).

| look | cam | sun elev | luma | clip/crush % (train) | train vs world | hazard vs world | ground (sat) | sky | spawn-edge fog | bands |

| grassland.day@door1p | door1p | 38.8 | 114.3 | 0.0/4.58 (10.5) | 2.04:1 | None:1 | #728942 (0.35) | #AABDAF | 0.956 at 2048 | none |

Checks against canon: spawn-edge fog >= 0.9 hides the streamer's spawn edge (tech.lighting.atmosphere, tech.streaming.window); ground saturation <= 0.45 (style.material.ground_value); bands = frame and sky means tested against the Dead Rails sepia and Land or Die blue-sky bands (style.dont.*); contrast = relative luminance ratio in the same frame.

Limits: Previews are approximations, not Roblox: Cycles + a numpy post (filmic curve, Atmosphere fog from depth, bloom, sun rays, ColorCorrection). Skybox, Future light falloff and Roblox tone mapping are not modelled; phone variants assume no shadows and no Bloom/SunRays (tech.lighting.post_low_quality). The train is a stand-in (livery open, OQ-025). Studio test pending (owner).

## Effects

Side strips: steady state at Speed 35.0 (gameplay.speed.normal) on sky, pasture and dark (tunnel light 0.22) backdrops, or a time strip for bursts; a 5-stud avatar (tech.units.avatar_h) and a 5-stud bar give scale. The train never moves: drift is Workspace.GlobalWind.

| preset | kind | priority | anchor | start | live phone / pc (budget formula, full rate) | sim live (strip) | px/stud | canon / OQ |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| split_explosion | burst | 1 | SplitCore | event | 7 / 7 | 7/7/0/7 | 2.78 | none: owner decision 2026-09-29 (C10 'I want a big explosion aswell') overrides the OQ-028 default for the carriage split only; proposed · OQ-028 |

POV composites: particles over the lookdev plate from the same camera (PC 768x432, phone 844x390 at phone rates); loops at steady state at Speed gameplay.speed.fast, bursts shown t s after they fire. Per preset: visible/live, h = hidden by the train or ground, o = off-screen, share of the screen, then drawn alone over the plate: mean luma change / 90th-percentile luma change.

| POV | look | cam | tier | overdraw max/p95 | screen | per preset |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| split_explosion | grassland.day | roof3p | pc | 0/0 | 0.0% | split 0/7 h2 o5 0.00% |

Visibility (warnings are for the maker to fix before the critic; hidden counts are facts):
- WARN split_explosion: under 0.1% of the screen in every POV (best pov_split_explosion: 0 of 7 visible, 0.00%): players may never see it (references/presets.md, Visible from the players' views)

Budgets (assumed (OQ-029 default A): not canon until the owner decides; re-measure at the alpha live check (tech.streaming.live_check)); 1 sets holding a pack preset:
- phone: 1 of 1 sets within; tightest carriage_split: steady 74 of 400, peak 142 of 800, emitters 9 of 12, lights 4 of 8
- pc: 1 of 1 sets within; tightest carriage_split: steady 111 of 1500, peak 180 of 2500, emitters 9 of 24, lights 4 of 16

Limits: Effects are simulated from the preset data with Roblox ParticleEmitter rules; textures are procedural stand-ins for the built-ins; particles are not lit by the scene beyond a LightInfluence factor; lights show as glow dots only; drift = Workspace.GlobalWind at train speed. Studio test pending (owner).
